Before converting excel file to csv file, 
1. Change the date format by Right click on column header > format cells > custom > yyyy-mm-dd
2. Change all currencies to number type with two decimals
3. Convert excel file to csv file.

The Reason behind is the csv file won't store formating information, even if you save the formating in csv it won't be saved.
